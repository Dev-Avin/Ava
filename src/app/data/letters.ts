Just the thought of you being happy makes my day.

Your laughter, your joy — it’s like the happiness of a five-year-old who just got their favorite toy.
Sooo cute.
Sooo pretty.

  lonely: [
    {
      title: "You're Not Alone",
      content: `Dear Ava,

I know it feels lonely right now, but please remember - you are so loved, even when it doesn't feel that way.

Loneliness is just a feeling, not a forever state. It will pass. And while you wait for it to pass, know that there are people who care about you deeply.

Reach out when you're ready. Someone is always there.`
    },
    {
      title: "This Too Shall Pass",
      content: `Sweet friend,

Feeling lonely doesn't mean you are alone. Sometimes our hearts just need a little extra love and that's completely okay.

Be gentle with yourself during this time. Do something nice for yourself - watch your favorite movie, listen to music that comforts you, or simply rest.

Brighter days are coming.`
    },
    {
      title: "You Are Valued",
      content: `Ava,

Your presence in this world matters more than you know. Even when you feel disconnected, you are connected to so many hearts.

Sometimes we need solitude to recharge, and that's beautiful too. But know that whenever you're ready, there are arms waiting to welcome you back.

You are treasured.`
    },
    {
      title: "Connection is Coming",
      content: `Dear one,

Loneliness can feel heavy, but it's also teaching you something important about what you need and value in relationships.

Use this time to reconnect with yourself. Sometimes we need to be our own best friend first. And then, when you're ready, the right connections will find you.

Hold on.`
    },
    {
      title: "You Matter So Much",
      content: `Beautiful Ava,

When loneliness creeps in, it can make us forget our worth. But your worth isn't determined by how many people are around you right now.

You are valuable, you are loved, and you are never truly alone. Sometimes the universe just needs us to slow down and look inward.

Better days are ahead.`

  sad: [
    {
      title: "It's Okay to Cry",
      content: `Dear Ava,

Your tears are valid. Your sadness is real. And you don't have to put on a brave face or pretend everything is fine.

Let yourself feel what you're feeling. Sadness isn't weakness - it's proof that you have a deep capacity to care and feel.

Take all the time you need to heal.`
    },
    {
      title: "Gentle Healing",
      content: `Sweet Ava,

Today might feel heavy, and that's okay. You don't have to carry it all at once. Take it moment by moment, breath by breath.

Be as kind to yourself as you would be to your best friend. Rest when you need to. Cry when you need to. And know that this feeling won't last forever.

You're stronger than you know.`
    },
    {
      title: "Wrapped in Comfort",
      content: `Dearest Ava,

Imagine this letter as a warm hug wrapping around you. You're not alone in your sadness, even when it feels like you are.

It's okay to not be okay. Give yourself permission to just exist today without any pressure or expectations.

Tomorrow is a new day.`
    },
    {
      title: "Light After Dark",
      content: `Dear friend,

Even the darkest nights end with sunrise. Your sadness is temporary, even though it feels permanent right now.

What you're going through is real and it matters. But so do you. And you will get through this, one small step at a time.

Keep going.`
    },
    {
      title: "You Will Smile Again",
      content: `Precious Ava,

I know you can't see it right now, but there will come a day when this sadness is just a memory. You will laugh again, smile again, feel light again.

Until then, be patient with yourself. Healing isn't linear. Some days will be harder than others, and that's part of the process.

You're doing better than you think.`

  frustrated: [
    {
      title: "Take a Deep Breath",
      content: `Dear Ava,

I can feel your frustration from here. Everything feels like it's going wrong, and you just want to scream. That's completely understandable.

Before you do anything else, take three deep breaths. Sometimes our best solutions come when we step back for just a moment.

You've got this.`
    },
    {
      title: "Your Feelings Are Valid",
      content: `Hey there,

Frustration is your brain's way of saying "this isn't working!" And that's actually good information to have.

You're not being dramatic. You're not overreacting. You're having a normal human response to a difficult situation. Now, what can we change?

Let's figure this out together.`
    },
    {
      title: "Power Through",
      content: `Ava,

I know everything feels impossible right now. But remember all those other times you felt this way? And remember how you made it through every single one of them?

You're more capable than you give yourself credit for. This frustration is temporary. Your resilience is permanent.

Keep pushing forward.`
    },
    {
      title: "It's Okay to Step Away",
      content: `Dear one,

Sometimes the best thing you can do when frustrated is to simply walk away for a bit. Not giving up - just giving yourself space to breathe.

Come back to it with fresh eyes later. Or ask for help. Or try a completely different approach. You have options, even when it doesn't feel like it.

Take a break if you need it.`

      title: "Channel That Energy",
      content: `Strong Ava,

That frustration you're feeling? That's just passion and energy that needs a better direction. You care so much, and that's beautiful.

Take that fire and use it as fuel. Dance it out, write it out, talk it out. Transform that frustration into motivation.

You're unstoppable when you channel your power.`

  demotivated: [
    {
      title: "Rest is Productive",
      content: `Dear Ava,

Feeling demotivated doesn't mean you're lazy or failing. It means you need rest, recovery, or a different approach.

Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is nothing at all. Your worth isn't measured by your productivity.

Be gentle with yourself today.`
    },
    {
      title: "Small Steps Count",
      content: `Sweet Ava,

You don't have to climb the whole mountain today. You don't even have to take big steps. Just one tiny step is enough.

Brush your teeth. Drink some water. Open the curtains. These small things matter more than you know when motivation is low.

You're doing great.`
    },
    {
      title: "Rediscover Your Why",
      content: `Dearest Ava,

When motivation fades, it's time to reconnect with your purpose. Why did you start this journey? What dreams are you chasing?

Sometimes we just need to remember our "why" to reignite the spark. And if that "why" no longer serves you, it's okay to find a new one.

Your path is yours to choose.`
    },
    {
      title: "You're Still Amazing",
      content: `Beautiful soul,

Lack of motivation doesn't erase all the amazing things you've already accomplished. You're still the same incredible person, just going through a low-energy phase.

This is temporary. Your spark will return. Until then, be patient and compassionate with yourself.

You haven't lost your magic.`
    },
    {
      title: "Permission to Pause",
      content: `Dear Ava,

Here's your official permission slip to slow down. To rest. To not have it all figured out right now.

Sometimes we need these demotivated moments to reassess and recalibrate. Use this time wisely - not to beat yourself up, but to nurture yourself.

The fire will return when you're ready.`

Your heart speaks the language of love fluently, and it's one of the most beautiful things about you. Never apologize for being affectionate and expressive.
