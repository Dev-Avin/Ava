Get some KitKat or Crispello 🍫

    content: `Hey you,

Come here.
Just… a little closer.
A little more.
Perfect — just the way you are.

Heyyy baby,
how are you doing? 😌  
You’re fine as salt, and I love it.
I love your quirks, your features, your talk, your walk —
and everything that comes in between.

Hey baby,
I want you closer than ever,
in a way we never have been before.
I want to hear that lovely voice
in a quiet, isolated room,
filled with your soft murmurs and sighs.

Just thinking about you does *a lot* to me.
So come along, baby —
a little closer than ever,
a little deeper than ever. 💫`

    title: "Soft but Not Innocent 😈",
    content: `Pretty baby,

You look very innocent sometimes,
but we both know that’s not the full story.

You’re cute all over, baby —
your lips, your eyes, your legs, your thighs,
and all the things that aren’t said out loud.
Everything about you pulls me in.

I want to smudge the shade of your lipstick,
leave a soft blush on those round cheeks,
hear you whisper my name,
breathing a little faster than usual.

And I want you to remember
who you belong to —
because let’s be real,
I know you want this too.

So tell me…
who do you belong to? 🖤

(Not so innocent)
kitten 😌`

    title: "Late-Night Thoughts 🌙",
    content: `It’s late.

And for some reason,
you’re on my mind more than usual.
Way more than usual.

The sound of your voice in my ears,
the way your touch feels on my skin,
the way your hands move,
the way you breathe,
the sounds you make —
all of it keeps me awake sometimes.

I want to hear it again.
I know you do too.

Tell me, baby…
what do you want?
How do you want it?
When do you want it?

Don’t be shy.
Some things just belong to you —
the same way you belong to me. 🔥`

    title: "That Look 👀",
    content: `You know the look.

The one you give when you’re not saying anything,
but everything is already being said.

Yeah.
That one.

Please don’t stop doing that.
It should honestly be illegal.

I love those eyes —
the way they reveal your intent
before your lips ever do.
The way you close them
right in the middle of the moment.
The way you react,
the way you pull me in closer.

A little more of you.
A little more of me.
A little more of us.

That look…
it does wonders. 🖤`

    title: "Come Back Here 🔥",
    content: `Hey.

Where do you think you’re going?

You started this —
that smile, that tone, that energy,
those words, those actions.

Now come back.
Sit.
Relax.

I just want you right here,
exactly like this.

Good girl 😌

Let’s see how long that sass lasts.
I want to hear that apology
in a soft, trembling voice.

A lot of emotions will rise in you,
deep inside —
unavoidable, intense,
but still warm and enjoyable.

You’ll enjoy it.
That’s not a promise, baby…

…it’s a warning. 🔥`
