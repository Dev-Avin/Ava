This feeling of calm and contentment is your gift to yourself. Let go of worries, rest your mind, and simply be.

You are doing wonderfully, even in these quiet moments. They matter just as much as any adventure.`

    title: "A Little Too Close",
    content: `Hey you,

Come here.
Just… a little closer.

I like the way you make eye contact when you’re teasing,
like you already know what you’re doing to me.

There’s something about you when you’re confident —
it’s quiet, but it’s dangerous.

Don’t say anything.
Just stay.
That’s enough.`

    title: "Soft but Not Innocent",
    content: `Pretty babyy,

You look very innocent sometimes,
but we both know that’s not the full story.

The way you smile,
the way you pause before speaking —
it gives you away.

I like that contrast.
Soft on the outside,
trouble underneath.

And honestly?
I don’t want you any other way.`

And for some reason,
you’re on my mind a little more than usual.

Maybe it’s the way you laugh.
Maybe it’s the way you say my name.
Maybe it’s just you.

Whatever it is —
it’s distracting.

I hope you’re thinking of me too.`

    title: "That Look",

The one you give when you’re not saying anything,
but everything is being said.

Yeah.
That one.

Please don’t stop doing that.
It should honestly be illegal.`

    title: "Come Back Here",
    content: `Hey.

Where do you think you’re going?

You started this.
That smile, that tone, that energy.

Now come back.
Sit.
Relax.

I just want you right here,
exactly like this.`
